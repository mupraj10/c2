# Cedrus Technical Challenge

Hi! This is a coding challenge completed by [Maggy Prajapati](mailto:mupraj10@gmail.com)

## Instructions

1.  Navigate to [repo](https://github.com/mupraj10/c2) and clone locally using
    `git clone git@github.com:mupraj10/c2.git`

2.  Install dependencies using `npm install`
3.  Create two db called `rover` and `rover-test`
4.  Start your server using `npm run start-dev`
5.  Navigate to app in [browser](http://localhost:8080)
6.  Enjoy!

## Problem

#### Create an app called: Rover

Rover is an app that is similar to Tinder but for you pets and enable you to find a vet for your pet by matching.

I used the following technologies: Node, Express, Sequelize, React, Redux.

I used postgres for my db.

I used [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/) for styling.

I used a premade boilermaker from [Fullstack](https://www.fullstackacademy.com) with more instructions [here](instructions.md)

## Notes

#### Things I was able to accomplish:

* User journey
  * As a user you
  * can log in and get to your home page
  * can view a gallery of pets
  * can view a gallery of vets
* Code
  * Backend
    * API routing for pet and vet
    * Models for pet and vet
      -Frontend
  * Components for Pet Galley and Vet Profiles
  * Implemented redux for Pets

#### If I had more time:

* I would want to
  * complete all the test specs I could not get to
  * add more validations to my db models
  * implement the associations between
  * finish implementing the single pet and vet view
  * add better styling to the gallery views
  * implment a matching function
